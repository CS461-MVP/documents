Today, a professor can either choose a textbook from a catalog, or write one of their own. Pre-written textbooks often contain unnecessary chapters, or can even be missing chapters viewed as critical. Writing one's own textbook, on the other hand, can take months or years of research and editing.

The Many Voices platform instead allows professors to create their own textbooks by using crowd-sourced content. A knowledgeable professor can contribute a chapter or unit on their specialty, and use materials others have contributed to create the exact textbook they want for their class. The finished platform will allow users to see existing textbooks, customize them using their own or third party materials, and contribute their customizations back to other professors.

To ensure the platform meets the defined needs and functions as according to plan, we will, in our best efforts, attempt to meet every two weeks with our client to discuss current progress on and proposed functionality for the application. Before continuing major aspects of the platform, we will discuss our present status and inquire as to whether our current progress meets the expectations desired. After reaching an agreement, we will continue to adjust and shape the platform where necessary and reasonable.
