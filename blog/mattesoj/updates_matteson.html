          Getting Everything finalized was quite a stretch this week, me and Steven had to power through getting our project webpage set up.
          We also had to get our Problem Statement signed by everybody in the group as well as our client. Next week, we are planning on
          figuring out a time for our team to meet consistently, as well as figure out user stories. We ran into some problems this week
          just trying to get everybody to sign our Problem Statement on time. Another problem we ran into was getting a hold of our client
          on time. Thankfully, we got everything finished and turned in on time. We'll hopefully be more on top of things next week.
