        <h4>Blog Update 1</h4>
        <p>This week was crazy! Getting our problem statement ironed out took a little longer than we anticipated. Mainly getting my teammates to be able to commit to working on the documents and revisions so we could meet the assignment criteria. Josh was able to meet with me on the 14th. Josh and I continued with my draft of the problem statement and the two of us created the blog platform. It was stressful, but we were able to get everything signed and turned in on time, thankfully.</p>
        <p>Last week we met with our client for the first time and layed the plans for the MVP platform as a whole, including long term goals of actually processing the formatting of documents.</p>
        <p>For next week I am not sure what to expect, I do know that at the end of the month we have our project requirements documents coming up.
