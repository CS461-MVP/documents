      <div><p class="intro">The Many Voices Publishing Platform allows professors from all
        walks of life to have an equal opportunity to create the textbook
        they desire using textbook materials from peers around the world or
        create them from scratch.</p>
        <p class="intro">The MVP Platform encourages a more publicly available publishing
          concept where documents aren't necessarily a single person's writing,
          but "open source" documents edited by whoever wants to change them to
          fit their needs.</p>
