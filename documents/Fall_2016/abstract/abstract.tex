\centerline{\sc \large Abstract}
\vspace{2pc}

\hspace{10mm}The purpose of this project is to remedy problems associated with the current textbook market and standard expectations that come with textbooks. The Many Voices Publishing Platform was developed to alleviate costs of textbooks for students as well as providing instructors the ability to create their own textbooks using an open platform for collaboration and specificity of focus. This platform was created using Ward Cunninghamâ€™s federated wiki as a project base and was expanded upon to provide the ability to define and implement a collaborative platform for authoring.
