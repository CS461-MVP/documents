%{\noindent  \par}


%\subsection{Software design in context}
%{\noindent  \par}

\subsection{Software design descriptions within the life cycle}
{\noindent The Software Design Description (SDD) is based in large part upon
the System and Software Requirements Specification (SSRS) document.
Requirements listed within the SSRS influence details within the SDD and
the SDD may influence the SSRS details.\par}


%Section 4
\section{Design Description}
{\noindent \par}

\subsection{Introduction}
{\noindent When designing software to handle the creation of a textbook,
the technologies in the background are equally as necessary as those in the foreground.
The creation of a textbook requires various systems and technologies to handle
the storing and presentation of data to allow the user to create their project.\par}

%\subsection{SDD identification}
%{\noindent \par}

\subsection{Design Stakeholders}
{\noindent The stakeholders consist of Dr. Carlos Jensen, members of the Oregon
State University senior capstone educational team, including Professor D. Kevin McGrath,
Dr. Kirsten M. Winters, and PhD student Jonathan Dodge.
Additional stakeholders include the development team consisting of Steven Powers,
Evan Tschuy, and Josh Matteson.\par}

\subsection{Design Concerns}
{\noindent The design concerns for this project include the building of a User Interface
with a functional JavaScript framework that allows for ease of use for users and developers.

User login and authentication will also be a design concern for this project,
as preventing unintended access to another users work is very important.

Another concern consists of the usability of the interface and being able
to inform the user of actions they expect to perform and can perform to
complete their task of creating a textbook. \par}

\subsection{Design Views}
{\noindent The SDD will use UML diagrams to describe and visualize aspects of the design. \par}

\subsection{Design Viewpoints}
{\noindent This SDD will cover a number of different viewpoints, including:
context, composition, logical, dependency, information, interface, and interaction viewpoints.

Context viewpoints cover the relationships, dependencies, and
interactions between the system and its environment \cite{viewpoints}.

Composition viewpoints cover what information will be handled by the software.

Logical viewpoints cover what purpose the software will serve and how the software will achieve this purpose.

Dependency viewpoints cover outside elements that need to be integrated
into the software in some way, as the implementation will depend on these outside elements.

Information viewpoints cover data that is present within the software or managed by the software in some way.

Interface viewpoints cover how designers and developers will be using the software,
detailing the internal and external interfaces of the software.

Interaction viewpoints cover the interactions between different entities or elements within the software. \par}

\subsection{Design Elements}
{\noindent Design elements within our software will include a variety of different
features that are often considered standard elements within software.
These elements include buttons, text boxes, search boxes, menus, and clickable links just to name a few.
The menus of the system will be limited for user convenience and will provide a meaningful icon or text representation
for quick affordability for the user. Within the text editing area, the user will be able to arrange
text how they would like it to appear in a finalized---compiled version.

The text area will also allow users to specify other documents to include,
which will be handled by the software in the background at time of compilation.
Each included document or file will be stored as a separate document with version control capabilities. \par}

%\subsection{Design Overlays}
%{\noindent \par}

\subsection{Design Rationale}
{\noindent For this project, design choices are made based on client specifications as well as development concerns
due to technology availability and adaptability to the current system.
Our client Dr. Carlos Jensen wants the project to allow for the easy creation of
textbooks through what is called the Many Voices Publishing Platform.
Design choices will be made to accommodate this requirement.\par}

\subsection{Viewpoint: User Interface Tools}
{\noindent By: Steven Powers \par}

\subsubsection{Interface}
{\noindent The user interface is one of the most important parts to the Many
Voices Publishing Platform. An easy to use UI can make the difference between
two competing software solutions. The Many Voices Publishing Platform will be
interacted through a website that will display a users documents and their current
document. The User Interface Tools will allow for a high quality user experience
with a high number of screen repaints per second, further increasing the ease of use
with the software through a fluid user interface \cite{Eisenberg}.\par}

\subsubsection{Design Concerns}
{\noindent A poorly implemented UI can result in users choosing a competing
product or simply deciding not to use any software for their intended purpose.
Users are often impatient and quick to abandon software,
further proving the need for a robust and easy to use User Interface Toolset.  \par}

\subsubsection{Design Elements}
{\noindent The User Interface Tools will allow for scalability when it comes to
using the software on different platforms, including mobile, and desktop environments.
Additionally the tools will provide great interact-ability for the user.\par}

\subsubsection{Function Attribute}
{\noindent This component provides the user interface for users to interact with while using the software.
Handles display of information and provides the interface for input.  \par}

\subsubsection{Relationship}
\begin{figure}[ht!]

	Aurelia will enable transmission of data to the screen or from the screen, up to date as of Fall term}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{Viewpoint: User Login \& Authentication}
{\noindent By: Steven Powers  \par}

\subsubsection{Context--Dependency}
{\noindent A user login system is standard affair for most websites on the Internet.
How these user logins take place and authenticate users can vary quite
significantly depending on the implementation.
User login security is important for protecting the customer as well as
the reputation of the software and company. User Login \& Authentication
are dependent on Evan Tschuy's section on Password Storage section. \par}

\subsubsection{Design Concerns}
{\noindent Handling user logins and user authentication can be quite a painstaking process,
as any mistake can cost you customers and any reputation that was present
before the mistake was exploited. Authentication, or the matching of user submitted
data with our stored credentials can be exploited though a simple MySQL command,
if our servers are not secured properly. In house solutions can be buggy, or not as secure.
Third party solutions require an account with those services and has security in their hands. \par}

\subsubsection{Design Elements}
{\noindent A way to login securely, through created credentials or through a
third party login system, such as Login with Facebook or Google.  \par}

\subsubsection{Function Attribute}
{\noindent This component provides the functionality of user login process
and user authentication within the software.\par}

\subsubsection{Relationship}



\subsection{Viewpoint: Interface Design}
{\noindent By: Steven Powers \par}

\subsubsection{Information}
{\noindent The approach for user interface design is quite different
than that of the tools being used. Interface Design refers to the
methodologies employed to create the UI. This often takes the form of
user studies, and demoing of prototypes and release candidate mockups
for feedback. For our software, our target audience is professors,
especially those interested in publishing their own book currently or
in the near future. Using the target audience as a design requirement,
the designer is able to gleam a lot of information about how to best
serve this user.
Methodologies include user centered design, activity centered design,
and self design principles to list a few common disciplines.   \par}

\subsubsection{Design Concerns}
{\noindent Interface Design is an often overlooked portion of any software product.
For some software products it would be no surprise that the software is never
used in house, we are trying to avoid this feeling.
User centered design, while often the standard for the Computer Science industry, it
very costly, both in terms of time and money. There is a large amount of time into
user research studies and live demos. Self design, while much faster,
and easier to perform, can lead to results that do not satisfy your users expectations.\par}

\subsubsection{Design Elements}
{\noindent An Interface Design methodology that allows for efficient
use of time as well as successful design choices to best suit our users. \par}

\subsubsection{Function Attribute}
{\noindent Provides methodologies for improving Interface Design to assist
users and developers. \par}

\newpage

improve a UI for increased affordance and usability for the target
audience, up to date as of Fall term}

%Evan's Section
\newpage
\subsection{Viewpoint: Server Back-end}
{\noindent By: Evan Tschuy \par}

\subsubsection{Backend}
{\noindent
A standard web application follows more or less a standard design flow. When a
request is received, a URL parser parses the URL and passes it to the appropriate
function, along with all of its parameters. The function then operates on the data
somehow, and returns either the result of a template render or a block of data
in JSON/XML to be returned to the client. Inside the function, the heavy lifting
of data manipulation, storage, etc. takes place.
\par}

\subsubsection{Design Concerns}
The main concern for the backend of the project is how the back end will communicate
with the version control system. For instance, building on top of Git, it is
necessary to also verify that the backend language chosen has a library that can
be used to easily interact with Git. Then, it will be necessary to build an internal
library that can be placed on top of Git that exposes only the operations needed
for the textbook project.
{\noindent  \par}

\subsubsection{Design Elements}
{\noindent
The backend design, especially the layer interacting with Git, will play a critical
role in speed of development. By implementing a Snippet and Textbook super-layer
on top of the existing Git library, we can eliminate having to think about Git
as early as possible, and spend our time instead on interacting with Snippets and
the Textbooks.
\par}

\subsubsection{Function Attribute}
{\noindent This function provides the base on which the rest of the project is
built — the interaction layer between the frontend and the revision control system. \par}

\subsubsection{Relationship}






\subsection{Viewpoint: Text Formatting}
{\noindent By: Evan Tschuy \par}

\subsubsection{Formatting}
The front end of the platform lets users interact with "snippets" of documents —
a block of text that, paired with potentially dozens of other snippets, can make
a chapter. Then, chapters need to be combined together to make a full textbook.
Using a LaTeX backend, snippets can be related to an \begin{verbatim}\input{}\end{verbatim} command, which takes
the raw commands of a document and puts them into another document. Chapters can
be related to \begin{verbatim}\include{}\end{verbatim} commands, which start a new page and add the new section.
In this way, we can have one file for the table of contents, which controls which
chapters are included in which order, and one file for each chapter, which controls
which snippets are included in which order.
\iffalse
Users expect to be able to add things to documents like bolded text, tables, etc.
From a design perspective, this means adding an intermediary step between what
a user can use as input, and how that gets stored as plain text in a raw document
on the backend. Already today many web-based LaTeX and Markdown editors exist, and
so the goal for the platform will be to integrate an existing editor into the
user interface in a friendly way.
\fi
{\noindent  \par}

\subsubsection{Design Concerns}
The files referenced are all stored in version control, as discussed below.
Therefore we need to relate the files to a specific version as stored. Additionally,
it needs to be entirely invisible to users how the text is being split — the users
should not know whether the backend is written in LaTeX using include and input
statements, or in Markdown with string concatenation, or any other possible
implementation.
\iffalse
A user cannot know how their text is being transformed between what they can
interact with on the front end and how it is being stored in the back end. This
means the user should only ever have to deal with a "rich text" editor, like those
found in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, with the ability to do all text manipulation
with convenient nearby buttons.
\fi
{\noindent  \par}

\subsubsection{Design Elements}
An abstraction of snippets and chapters into LaTeX documents in such a way as to
make manipulation of them individually and as a whole simple.
{\noindent  \par}

\subsubsection{Function Attribute}
This component provides the functionality of document generation, storage, and
manipulation.
{\noindent  \par}

\subsubsection{Relationship}


\subsection{Viewpoint: Password Storage}
{\noindent By: Evan Tschuy \par}

\subsubsection{Password hashing}
Any time a password is being requested from a user, it should be securely and
irreversibly hashed. By securely hashing a password, it becomes impossible for
hackers with access to the user database to use stored credentials to compromise
user accounts on other sites even if users reuse passwords between sites. A well
designed cryptographic hash, such as bcrypt, includes a salt value, which is
simply added to the beginning of the password at hash time, stored in the
database in plain text, so that two uses of the same password result in
different hashes.
{\noindent  \par}

\subsubsection{Design Concerns}
A secure password storage system always hashes passwords, and requires hackers
to crack each password individually by guessing passwords one by one. Another
alternative to storing user passwords at all is, as discussed above in the user
authentication section, to use a third-party user authentication service such as
those offered by Google, Facebook, etc. For a platform used by professors, who
may not all have a Google or Facebook account, however, it should always be
possible to create an account that does not require a third-party account.
{\noindent  \par}

\subsubsection{Design Elements}
A well-designed, secure system in which any password stored cannot be reversed
without a slow cracking process. Preferably, users would not store any passwords
at all with the service and instead would use third-party authentication.
{\noindent  \par}

\subsubsection{Function Attribute}
This component provides the functionality of secure password storage.

\section{Conclusion}
{\noindent  The Many Voices Publishing Platform is a combination of User Interfaces, Documentation, User Centered Design, Testing, User Authentication, Databases, Server Back-end, Text Formatting, Password Storage, and the users themselves. Determining the technologies behind these parts and pieces is a difficult task to accomplish, as many choices can satisfy the requirements of the project. Finding the best solution however is the goal of this document, to provide a clear path forward for the platform as a whole. \par}
