\section[Introduction]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} Introduction}

\subsection[IDENTIFICATION]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} IDENTIFICATION}


{\noindent
The software system being considered for development is referred to as the Many Voices
Publishing Platform. \ The customer providing specifications
for the system is Dr. Carlos Jensen that is reachable at his email jensenca@engr.orst.edu \
The ultimate customer, or end-user, of the system will be any user that wants an easier
way to combine materials into a book. \ This is a new project effort, so the
version under development is version 0.5 release 0. As the system may be based off of Ward Cunningham's 
Federated Wiki, the project will have a substantial head start, signified by the 0.5 version number \cite{Federated}.}

\subsection[PURPOSE]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} PURPOSE}

{\noindent 
The purpose of the system under
development is to provide a collaborative authoring platform that allows for users to
combine various materials into a book. \ While the system will be used by professors and
instructors in majority, this document is intended to be read and understood by software
designers and coders. \ The document will also be vetted or
approved by Dr. Carlos Jensen, D. Kevin McGrath, and Dr. Kirsten Winters.}

\subsection[SCOPE]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} SCOPE}

{\noindent 
The project is sponsored by Dr. Carlos Jensen, being developed by Josh Matteson,
Steven Powers, and Evan Tschuy for completion of CS461 Senior capstone project class.
The product is to be operated via a website for wide availability and use.}

\section[OVERALL DESCRIPTION]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} OVERALL DESCRIPTION}

\subsection[PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE}

{\noindent
The main differentiator from traditional textbook publication methods are the products'
micro-writing abilities. A traditional textbook is written by one expert, using a defined
curriculum that fits the needs of the author. The curriculum is a generic version of a
multitude of classes that is somewhat useful for many professors, rather than very useful
for few professors. Instead, our solution will give the tools necessary for individual 
professors to create the textbook they need to match the curriculum desired. This allows 
for textbooks that more closely track the intricacies of how classes are taught by 
different individuals.}

\subsection[PRODUCT FUNCTIONS]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} PRODUCT FUNCTIONS}

{\noindent 
The product will be a document construction service. The most basic usage will be the 
creation of a textbook out of pre-existing chapters, by searching and selecting from a 
list. Alternatively, chapters can created using pre-existing sections and media.
A chapter or section can be created using a simple input interface that
accepts text and LaTeX markup, along with the upload of media like image or
perhaps video content.}

\subsection[USER CHARACTERISTICS]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} USER CHARACTERISTICS}

{\noindent 
The expected user of the service will be a professor. Professors, in general, have
decent means technical skills. Thus, the interface of the product
will be highly graphically driven, using modern interface paradigms as defined
by industry leaders, such as Google's Material Design \cite{GoogleMaterial}. 
The interface will allow users to not think about the technical specificities of the product, 
but more-so on the content they are using, the authors of the content, and how they are using it.}

\subsection[CONSTRAINTS]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} CONSTRAINTS}

{\noindent 
A regular web browser will be the means of access for users. For the backend
server, the main requirement is availability - as a web application, it has no
safety- or life-critical components. A high (99.99\%) availability should be provided,
but otherwise availability, safety, and specific hardware are not main concerns.}

\bigskip

{\noindent 
The software can, as a web application, be written in a high-level language, with
minimal inter-application communication. In the case that the software is built
on top of other applications, such as Git, inter-process communication should be
handled in a generic way that provides a high-security barrier, preventing malicious
users from accessing other, non-specified applications.}

\subsection[ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES}

{\noindent
The product will be designed to run on a generic Linux-with-web server environment.
Ward Cunningham's Federated Wiki, a similar project being drawn upon for inspiration, can run
on any system with Ruby and CouchDB (a popular NoSQL database) \cite{Federated}. 
With the product being either partially or wholly based on the Federated Wiki, similar system
requirements are anticipated \cite{Federated}.

\subsection[SYSTEM LEVEL (NON{}-FUNCTIONAL) REQUIREMENTS]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} SYSTEM LEVEL (NON-FUNCTIONAL) REQUIREMENTS}


\subsubsection[Site Dependencies]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} Site Dependencies}
As a web application, the product has no hard requirements other than high-speed
network access and an instance of the CouchDB database management system.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Hardware: standard virtual machine(s) running on cloud provider (ex: Amazon EC2 
  t2.medium)
  \item Possible Database: CouchDB 2.0
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection[Safety, Security and Privacy Requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} Safety, Security and Privacy Requirements}

{\noindent 
Private information shall be held to any relevant security standards. For instance,
any credit card information processed by the product in the textbook creation process
will be held to PCI compliance standards. Passwords shall be stored in a securely hashed,
non-reversible method, such that infiltration of the product by an unauthorized
third party will not be able to result in the theft of user passwords or other private
information.}

\subsubsection[Performance Requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} Performance Requirements}

{\noindent
A standard user load shall be defined as up to 100 simultaneous users. User information
will include things such as text documents, media uploads, and user account data.

Under a standard load:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 95\% of save operations (excepting media upload time) shall be responsive in 
  nature.
  \item 95\% of initial page loads shall shall be responsive in 
  nature.
  \item 95\% of user account operations (login, creation, deletion, etc) shall be 
  responsive in nature.
\end{itemize}}

\subsubsection[System and Software Quality]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} System and Software Quality}

The software shall maintain 99.99\% accessibility from the major modern web browsers, including Mozilla FireFox, 
Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge.
As a non-safety-critical product, reliability shall be attempted but not promised
to end users. Testing shall be handled through a suite of automated unit and integration testing, as well as
through manual checking of newly written and critical features.

\subsubsection[Packaging and Delivery Requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} Packaging and Delivery Requirements}

{\noindent 
The executable system and all associated documentation (i.e., SSRS,
code listing, test plan (data and results), and user manual) will be
delivered to the customer on CD{\textquoteright}s and/or via email, as
specified by the customer at time of delivery. \ Although document
{\textquotedblleft}drops{\textquotedblright} will occur throughout the
system development process, the final, edited version of the above
documents will accompany the final, accepted version of the executable
system.}

\subsubsection[Personnel{}-related requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} Personnel-related requirements} 

{\noindent
The system under development has no special personnel-related characteristics. }

\subsubsection[Training{}-related
requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black}
Training-related requirements}
%\noindent {\color{black}
%{\textit{This paragraph shall specify the
%system requirements, if any, pertaining to training. \ Examples include
%training software, tutorials, or help information to be included in the
%system.}}{ \ \ }}

\noindent {\color{black}
No training materials or expectations will be tied to this project other
than the limited help screens built into the software and the
accompanying user manual.}

\subsubsection[Logistics{}-Related Requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} Logistics-Related Requirements}

\noindent {\color{black}
The software shall run on a standard Amazon Web Services backend instance with
another standard instance serving as the database.


\subsubsection[Other Requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} Other Requirements}

{\noindent No other system requirements are anticipated.}

\subsubsection[Precedence and Criticality of Requirements]{\rmfamily\bfseries\color{black} Precedence and Criticality of Requirements}

{\noindent The main critical requirements of the system are those relating to payment processing secrecy.}
